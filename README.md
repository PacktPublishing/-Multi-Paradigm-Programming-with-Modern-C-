 Multi-Paradigm Programming with Modern C++, published by Packt

This is the code repository for [Multi-Paradigm Programming with Modern C++ [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/multi-paradigm-programming-with-modern-c-video)
## About the Video Course

C++ is a multi-paradigm language that lets you solve a problem in different ways, and this course will teach you the best practices.Furthermore, C++ has been re-invented again. C++2a is the largest extension to the language since C++11, and it almost feels like a new language. Developers who master the new features will be able to write cleaner, faster and concurrent code. In this course, you will learn about the best practices of C++ programming, including project structure, designing interfaces and classes, C++ Core Guidelines, and the most recent language standard. The new features are numerous and cover almost every area of the language: modules let us organize our programs better; concepts help us create cleaner APIs; ranges forever change how we look at containers; concurrency features, such as coroutines, bring parallel and concurrent programming to a whole new level.
You will get plenty of practical experience with short, real-world code examples. By the end of this course, you will be ready to create better software using C++.
